By Justin Wei, completed April 13, 2017.

I created a phone book that allows users to add comments about their contacts.
There is a communal phone book view that everyone can view, search through, and sort.
There is also a page that allows users to see only the contacts that they themselves created.

I worked on this project with Murti Mubin and Seth Goodman.
